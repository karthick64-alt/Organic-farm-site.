                <h2>Returns</h2>
                <p>Due to the perishable nature of our products, we generally do not accept returns of fresh produce. However, we will provide refunds or replacements for items that don't meet our quality standards.</p>

                <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings or by contacting us. Cancellations will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. You will continue to receive deliveries until the end of your paid period.</p>
                <p>Refunds for subscription fees are prorated based on the remaining deliveries in your billing cycle.</p>

                <h2>Refund Processing</h2>
                <p>Refunds will be processed to the original payment method within 5-10 business days of approval. Processing times may vary depending on your financial institution.</p>

                <h2>Farm Visits and Workshops</h2>
                <p>Cancellations made at least 48 hours before a scheduled farm visit or workshop will receive a full refund. Cancellations made less than 48 hours in advance may receive a 50% refund or credit toward a future visit.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right to cancel or reschedule events due to weather or other circumstances beyond our control. In such cases, you will receive a full refund or the option to reschedule.</p>
